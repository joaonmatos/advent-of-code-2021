# Advent of Code 2021

Every December, in the lead up to Christmas, developers love to take part in yet
another another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), the yearly
Xmas-themed code competition.

Every year, me and other friends use this opportunity to learn a new language,
so I decided to pick the [Go language](https://golang.org/) for it.

Message me with your language picks for this year, and keep in touch with me
over the weeks to compare how we have been solving the problems!
